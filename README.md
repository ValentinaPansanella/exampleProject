Write a name (e.g. Group_X_2024_Project) and description (e.g. Analysis of COVID-19 misinformation diffusion) and set it Private (!).

Go to your terminal and type

```
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/yourRepositoryName
```

This will create a local repository in a new folder called yourRepositoryName inside the current folder. The local repository is connected with the remote repository at the link. 

If you wanto to collaborate on this project with your team, go to Settings and add collaborators. Just one person per team should create the repository, all others can ```git clone``` the repository the team leader created.  In this way you will all have push rights on the main branch.

Add a .gitignore file and add all the files and directories you do not want to be shared and/or online. E.e. the data/ folder should not be uploaded online due to privacy and memory issues. 

YOU ARE READY TO START WORKING ON YOUR PROJECT!
